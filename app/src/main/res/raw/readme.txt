If you have installed Git for Windows, you should have Git Bash installed, since that comes with Git.

Use the split command in Git Bash to split a file:

into files of size 500MB each: split myLargeFile.txt -b 500m

into files with 10000 lines each: split myLargeFile.txt -l 10000

Tips:

If you don't have Git/Git Bash, download at https://git-scm.com/download

If you lost the shortcut to Git Bash, you can run it using C:\Program Files\Git\git-bash.exe

That's it!
